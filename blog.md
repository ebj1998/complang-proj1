# Programming Project 1: A Story by Brady Murphy and Evan Jones

We learned a lot through numerous demands from the emperor as a royal information officer and various grammatical request at a botique investing firm. With these two distinct roles we will explore lessons learned. In our first role we created a parser for roman numerals in swift and in the second role we created a top down grammar parser in Python.
