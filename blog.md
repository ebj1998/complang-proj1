# Programming Project 1: Lessons Learned by Brady Murphy and Evan Jones

We learned a lot through many demands from the emperor as a royal information officer and various grammatical request at a boutique investing firm. In our first role we created a parser for roman numerals in swift and in the second role we created a top down grammar parser in Python. With these two distinct roles, we will explore our overall experience and lessons learned.

## Swiftly Parsing Roman Numerals

This task reminded us a lot of a programming problem a company might give for an interview, but it still created some interesting things learned due to it being in Swift. While going to create our parser, we slowly learned about Swift as a language and what makes it unique. 

One area we found was that Swift dealt with if-else semantic errors in an interesting way. We noticed that brackets must wrap any if-else statement completely. Also, Swift did not need the use of parenthesis for the boolean statement, yet it allowed the use regardless.

Another area we found interesting was through Swifts flexibility and minor limitations. We found that Swift was both a scripting and statically typed language depending on the use case. The support for Unicode characters natively also struck us as we had never seen a programming language have such easy support for Unicode. One area of limitation, however, was how indexing of strings (due to strings being various length) was not as intuitive as other languages we have worked with.
